## Working With Sources 

This is a solution based project, if you are on windows or macOS it can be opened easily with Visual Studio or Jetbrains Rider, on Linux Visual Studio is not available but Rider works fine. 

If you have dotnet installed on your machine but no other IDE you can still run the tests using `dotnet run` when you are in the BinBuffTest directory.
